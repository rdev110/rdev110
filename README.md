# Hi,

I'm a full‑stack developer who loves building scalable systems, clean APIs, and intuitive user interfaces.  
I work mostly with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, and cloud-native tooling.
I'm also deeply interested in Generative AI and how modern LLMs can improve developer productivity and real-world business use-cases.
