# Hi there 👋 I'm Rahul Dev

I'm a full‑stack developer who enjoys building useful, scalable, and clean software.  
I currently work as a Senior Associate at EY, where I build web apps, cloud‑based services, and AI‑powered solutions.

I love working across the stack — from designing APIs and optimizing backend systems to creating smooth, responsive UIs. I’m also very curious about Generative AI and how it can improve developer workflows and business processes.
